## React Pokedex

React + Vite, Material UI, CSS Modules, Firebase Hosting, Firestore

## Goals

1. Build a simple, full-stack application with vanilla React + Vite
2. **Showcase new React 19 hooks and APIs by fetching from a database without useEffect or 3rd party libraries and methods**
3. Gain a deeper understanding of React's CSR vs. Next.js's SSR and dynamic loading
4. Explore a Material UI methodology (again)
5. Conduct an informal developer experience review using: vanilla React + Vite, Firebase, Firestore, Material UI, CSS Modules

## Todo

- [x] Project scaffolding (materialui, firebase, prettier, etc)
- [x] Host project on Firebase Hosting
- [x] Build out basic UI
- [x] Implement PokeAPI calls
- [x] Display data
- [x] Setup firestore db
- [x] Refine UI
- [x] Refine 'client' actions
- [x] Add 'client' actions error-handling
- [x] Final UI refinement pass
- [ ] Update README (summary, review, tidying)

## Extras

- [ ] Implement basic authorization
- [ ] Add extra Pok√©mon data
- [ ] Add Fonts
- [ ] Dark and Light mode
- [ ] Fetch throttling
- [ ] Handle caching
- [ ] Optimistic updates
- [ ] Analytics

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev
# launch development server with live reloading, updates, and debugging.

pnpm build
# bundle project and create deployable app

firebase deploy
# Deploy newest version of built project (which is located in /dist)
# run this after 'pnpm build'
```

## Review

- REACT + Vite (React Framework) - 7/10

  - Pros
    - CSR feels nice, fast, uncomplicated for smaller apps
    - App setup with Vite is fast and easy
    - Vite hot reload and builds are really fast
    - Docs for core features are great
  - Cons
    - Needs extra libraries for a fully fleshed out experience (React Router, React Query, etc)
    - At the mercy of library authors to keep their libraries up-to-date
    - No native SSR
    - No image component like next.js
    - Docs for experimental things are just okay

- FIREBASE (Hosting) - 7/10

  - Pros
    - Easy access to a full suite of features (analytics, database, cloud, authentication)
    - UI and UX for dashboard is great. Data communication+++
    - Automatically utilizes a CDN, no extra setup
    - Nearly instant deploys to production
  - Cons
    - Paywall for many core features (app hosting, auto github deploys, cloud functions, etc)
    - Adds many files/overhead; in case you want to use one of their 10+ features.
    - Confusion between Firebase hosting (static, CSR sites) vs. Firebase 'app' hosting (full stack, SSR sites)
    - Documentation for brand new project was just okay
    - Firestore dashboard only updates once a day. Hard to accurately track reads and writes.
    - Github auto deploys randomly require access to all github projects (not just the firebase project)

- FIRESTORE (Database) - 8/10
- Pros

  - Excellent, efficient, straightforward online console interface
  - Straightforward syntax

- Cons

  - Decent amount of overhead when adding to project
  - Slight learning curve. Not 1:1 similar like when going from something like sqlite to postgresql
  - No way to perform some 'normal' actions like dropping a whole table with one command

- MATERIAL UI (Component Library) - 3/10
- Pros
  - Provides many components for many different use cases
  - If you have time to make custom themes, MUI can look great
- Cons
  - Customizing MUI component styles sucks. Sx, theme, styled components, etc feel much worse than just using Tailwind
  - Very time consuming to customize component styles
  - MUI's design is old. The framework's UI is still on Material 2. (Material 3 released 3 years ago)
  - MUI is confusingly, competing against themselves with 3 or 4 other half-baked products (Base UI, Joy UI, MUI System)
  - The only way to use responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, etc) on MUI components is through the Grid component, media queries, or adding MUI System to a project

CSS MODULES (CSS 'framework') - 6.5/10

- Pros
  - Tsx looks a lot cleaner without Tailwind style clutter
  - Deeper control with dedicated CSS files
- Cons
  - A new CSS file for every component is a lot of work and hard to keep track of
  - Consistent CSS formatting between module files is time consuming
  - Constant swapping between css and tsx files is tiring
