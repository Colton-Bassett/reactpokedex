## React Pokedex

React + Vite, Material UI, Emotion, Firebase Hosting, Firestore

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from "eslint-plugin-react";

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: "18.3" } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs["jsx-runtime"].rules,
  },
});
```

## Goals

1. Build a simple, full-stack application with vanilla React + Vite
2. **Showcase new React 19 hooks and APIs by fetching from a database without useEffect or other older lifecycle React methods**
3. Gain a deeper understanding of React's CSR vs. Next.js's SSR and dynamic loading
4. Explore a Material UI methodology (again)
5. Conduct an informal developer experience review using: vanilla React + Vite, Firebase, Firestore, Material UI, and Emotion

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev
# launch development server with live reloading, updates, and debugging.

pnpm build
# bundle project and create deployable app

firebase deploy
# Deploy newest version of built project (which is located in /dist)
# run this after 'pnpm build'
```

## Review

- MATERIAL UI
- using Material UI's 'sx' prop -- which is the system's solution to customizing css -- is pretty terrible. Looks exactly the same as vanilla html inline css style={{}} syntax. A strict downgrade to typescript

- i really am not a fan of the styled components solution either. It has benefits for sure, but I just don't like how there's huge blocks of styling i have to scroll past to get to the real code. There's also the issue of performance with both the above approaches.

- maybe they have great use-cases in enterprise level solutions where projects get exponentially big, but for smaller projects like these it feels like a lot of boiler plate and a lot of wasted time

- probably sticking with external css files and css modules. More performant + separation of converns. Probably just wishing I had tailwind tbh

- MUI is still stuck on material 2, they're working on material 3. But material 3 came out literally 2 or 3 years ago.

- aint now way they called this thing <grid2>

- kind of drowning in css files, something I forgot about with tailwind

- kind of tired organizing the styles in css files. I'm sure there's a prettier-esque extension to fix this but it's a pain

- REACT

- no image component like next.js
- no native ssr

- FIREBASE

- just setup hosting with firebase. Looks like you need the paid version for new firebase 'app' hosting, which has automatic github deploys and SSR + full stack app deploys (nextjs). Seems like a more modern solution. I instead setup regular firebase hosting which was a little confusing. The documentation was just okay.

- i don't really like that i have to add the npm install firebase to my project just for a simple deploy

- i don't really like that firebase wanted access to my entire github account (instead of just a repository) in order to deploy

- overall deploying was pretty painless and easy, but it seems if you're using firebase, it's probably for all the other features you get in addition to hosting (analytics, database, cloud, authentication, etc)

- firebase hosting is mainly for single page or static apps

- seems like firebase hosting automatically takes advantage of a CDN so I don't have to set that up. Very cool.

- i wanted to use firebase cloud functions but i had to enter a credit card and i did not like that
